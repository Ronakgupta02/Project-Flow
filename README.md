# Project-Flow
Project Flow is an advanced project management application designed to help teams collaborate, track progress, and deliver projects successfully. It provides a platform to organize, track, and complete projects by allowing users to create projects, add team members, and monitor progress through visual dashboards. The application is aimed at teams of all sizes and focuses on streamlining workflows and improving productivity.

Key features include:

Project Creation: Users can create new projects with names, descriptions, and assign them to specific categories like "Web Development," "Marketing," or "UI/UX Design".

Visual Progress Tracking: Each project displays its completion percentage with a colored progress bar. The status is clearly marked as "Not Started," "In Progress," or "Completed".

Task Management: The platform is built to manage a set number of tasks and team members for each project. A mockup shows tasks being tracked with statuses like "Done," "In Progress," and "To-Do".

Filtering and Organization: The main dashboard allows users to filter projects by their current status (e.g., "Active," "Completed") or by priority level ("High Priority") to quickly find what's important.

Team Collaboration: The tool is designed for teams, allowing multiple members to be associated with a project to keep everyone on the same page.
